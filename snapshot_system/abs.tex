\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a VM snapshot storage architecture which adopts multiple-level selective deduplication to bring the benefits of fine-grained data reduction into cloud backup storage systems.
In this work, we describe our working snapshot system implementation, and provide
early performance measurements for both deduplication impact and
snapshot operations.
Thank you!
