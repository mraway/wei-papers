A cloud environment that  hosts a large number of  virtual machines has
a high storage demand for frequent backup of system image snapshots.
Deduplication of data blocks can lead a big reduction of redundant blocks when
their signatures are identical. However it is expensive and less fault-resilient to perform a global comparison
of all data block signatures and let a data block share by many virtual machines. 
This paper studies a cluster-based design which collocates a lightweight
backup service with the cloud service and integrates multiple duplicate detection strategies that  
localize the deduplication as much as possible within each virtual machine.
The optimized design only requires a small amount of memory resource to conduct duplicate detection
and an analysis illustrates this design with deduplication localization  provides  better fault tolerance.
This  paper  provides an evaluation that shows this  proposed scheme can accomplish a high deduplication 
efficiency while sustaining a good backup throughput. 


%This paper studies the      a VM snapshot storage architecture which adopts multiple-level selective deduplication to bring the benefits of fine-grained data reduction into cloud backup storage systems.
%In this work, we describe our working snapshot system implementation, and provide
%early performance measurements for both deduplication impact and
%snapshot operations.
