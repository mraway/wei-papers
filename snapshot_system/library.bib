abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT. The economies of scale of very large-scale datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.},

@inproceedings{Breslau1999a,
abstract = {This paper addresses two unresolved issues about Web caching. The first issue is whether Web requests from a fixed user community are distributed according to Zipf's (1929) law. The second issue relates to a number of studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit certain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces. In particular, the question is whether these properties are inherent to Web accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facilitate both Web cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design. We show that the answers to the two questions are related. We first investigate the page request distribution seen by Web proxy caches using traces from a variety of sources. We find that the distribution does not follow Zipf's law precisely, but instead follows a Zipf-like distribution with the exponent varying from trace to trace. Furthermore, we find that there is only (i) a weak correlation between the access frequency of a Web page and its size and (ii) a weak correlation between access frequency and its rate of change. We then consider a simple model where the Web accesses are independent and the reference probability of the documents follows a Zipf-like distribution. We find that the model yields asymptotic behaviour that are consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the various observed properties of hit-ratios and temporal locality are indeed inherent to Web accesses observed by proxies. Finally, we revisit Web cache replacement algorithms and show that the algorithm that is suggested by this simple model performs best on real trace data. The results indicate that while page requests do indeed reveal short-term correlations and other structures, a simple model for an independent request stream following a Zipf-like distribution is sufficient to capture certain asymptotic properties observed at Web proxies},

@article{Baek2011,
abstract = {Why does Zipf's law give a good description of data from seemingly completely unrelated phenomena?
 Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be described as outcomes of a ubiquitous
 random group division: the elements can be citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the
 elements can be all the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the elements
 could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country and so on. A random group formation
 (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate is obtained based on minimal information: it
 provides the best prediction for the number of groups with k elements, given the total number of
 elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification of these
 three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution N ( k )∝exp(− bk )/ k $\gamma$ , where the
 power-law index $\gamma$ is a unique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is
 made possible by the fact that no system-specific assumptions are made about the mechanism
 responsible for the group division. The direct relation between $\gamma$ and the total number of elements,
 groups and the number of elements in the largest group is calculated. The predictive power of the
 RGF model is demonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is shown that
 $\gamma$ usually takes values in the interval 1≤$\gamma$≤2 and that the value for a given phenomenon depends in a
 systematic way on the total size of the dataset. The results are put in the context of earlier
 discussions on Zipf's and Gibrat's laws, N ( k )∝ k −2 and the connection between growth models and
 RGF is elucidated.},

Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this article, we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.},

@article{Breslau1999,
abstract = {This paper addresses two unresolved issues aboutWeb caching. The first issue is whetherWeb re- quests froma fixed user community are distributed according to Zipfs lawZip29. Several early studies have supported this claim Gla94, CBC95, ABCdO96 while other recent studies have suggested other- wise NHo 98, ACC 98. The second issue relates to a number of recent studies on the characteristics ofWeb proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit cer- tain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces CI97, RV98, DMF97, GB97a, KLM97. In particular, the second issue iswhether these properties are inherent toWeb accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facilitate bothWeb cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design. We show that the answers to the two questions are related. We first investigate the page request distribution seen byWeb proxy caches using traces from a variety of sources. We find that the distribu- tion does not follow Zipfs law precisely, but instead follows a Zipf-like distribution with the exponent varying from trace to trace. Furthermore, we find that there is (i) a weak correlation between the access frequency of a Web page and its size and (ii) a weak correlation between access frequency and its rate of change. We then consider a simple model where theWeb accesses are independent and the reference probability of the documents follows a Zipf-like distribution. We find that the model yields asymptotic behaviors that are consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the various observed properties of hit ratios and temporal locality are indeed inherent toWeb accesses observed by proxies. Finally, we revisitWeb cache replacement algorithms and show that the algorithm that is suggested by this simple model performs best on real trace data. The results indicate that while page requests do indeed reveal short-term correlations and other structures, a simple model for an independent request stream following a Zipf-like distribution is sufficient to capture certain asymptotic properties observed at Web proxies.},

@book{Saichev2010,
abstract = {Zipf's law is one of the few quantitative reproducible regularities found in economics. It states that, for most countries, the size distributions of city sizes and of firms are power laws with a specific exponent: the number of cities and of firms with sizes greater than S is inversely proportional to S. Zipf's law also holds in many other scientific fields. Most explanations start with Gibrat's law of proportional growth (also known as "preferential attachment'' in the application to network growth) but need to incorporate additional constraints and ingredients introducing deviations from it. This book presents a general theoretical derivation of Zipf's law, providing a synthesis and extension of previous approaches. The general theory is presented in the language of firm dynamics for the sake of convenience but applies to many other systems. It takes into account (i) time-varying firm creation, (ii) firm's exit resulting from both a lack of sufficient capital and sudden external shocks, (iii) the coupling between firm's birth rate and the growth of the value of the population of firms. The robustness of Zipf's law is understood from the approximate validity of a general balance condition. A classification of the mechanisms responsible for deviations from Zipf's law is also offered.},

There are various tools available to virtually reduce geographical distances and to support collaboration. Also for the management of knowledge appropriate solutions are available. But VOs typically have limited time to setup the entire IT- infrastructure for their collaboration. Therefore the trend to buy ready-to-use products exists. This paper characterizes requests of VOs for SaaS products, proposes functionalities to support team work and describes challenges with their solutions in the cloud.},

@article{Stocker2010,
abstract = {A new open-source software project is presented, JEMRIS, the J\"{u}lich Extensible MRI Simulator, which provides an MRI sequence development and simulation environment for the MRI community. The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the structure of specimens is crucial to determine the role that they play in cellular and molecular biology. To yield the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction by means of tomographic reconstruction algorithms, we need the use of large projection images and high processing time. Therefore, we propose the use of the high performance computing (HPC) to cope with the huge computational demands of this problem. We have implemented a HPC strategy where the distribution of tasks follows the master-slave paradigm. The master processor distributes a slab of slices, a piece of the final 3D structure to reconstruct, among the slave processors and receives reconstructed slices of the volume. We have evaluated the performance of our HPC approach using different sizes of the slab. We have observed that it is possible to find out an optimal size of the slab for the number of processor used that minimize communications time while maintaining a reasonable grain of parallelism to be exploited by the set of processors.},

abstract = {Computing as a utility has reached the mainstream. Scientists can now rent time on large commercial clusters through several vendors. The cloud computing model provides flexible support for "pay as you go" systems. In addition to no upfront investment in large clusters or supercomputers, such systems incur no maintenance costs. Furthermore, they can be expanded and reduced on-demand in real-time. Current cloud computing performance falls short of systems specifically designed for scientific applications. Scientific computing needs are quite different from those of web applications--composed primarily of database queries--that have been the focus of cloud computing vendors. In this paper we investigate the use of cloud computing for high-performance numerical applications. In particular, we assume unlimited monetary resources to answer the question, "How high can a cloud computing service get in the TOP500 list?" We show results for the Linpack benchmark on different allocations on Amazon EC2.},

abstract = {Affymetrix SNP arrays can interrogate thousands of SNPs at the same time. This allows us to look at the genomic content of cancer cells and to investigate the underlying events leading to cancer. Genomic copy-numbers are today routinely derived from SNP array data, but the proposed algorithms for this task most often disregard the genotype information available from germline cells in paired germline-tumour samples. Including this information may deepen our understanding of the "true" biological situation e.g. by enabling analysis of allele specific copy-numbers. Here we rely on matched germline-tumour samples and have developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate allelic copy-number changes in tumour cells. Further with this approach we are able to estimate the proportion of normal cells in the tumour (mixture proportion).},

abstract = {The concept of cloud computing is going to reorganise the tenets of enterprise IT. Cloud computing sounds like traditional IT outsourcing, but the difference is that this is not just about ownership of IT staff and resources, but a new way of organising, acquiring, and paying for IT infrastructures and services, with outsourcing being just part of the mix. Characterised this way, the move towards cloud computing seems certain, even if enterprises are reluctant to move forward too rapidly right now. Only a few enterprises are actually adopting cloud services at the moment, but the fact that any are is notable. This paper discusses cloud computing's progress within the enterprises.

abstract = {Computing as a utility has reached the mainstream. Scientists can now rent time on large commercial clusters through several vendors. The cloud computing model provides flexible support for "pay as you go" systems. In addition to no upfront investment in large clusters or supercomputers, such systems incur no maintenance costs. Furthermore, they can be expanded and reduced on-demand in real-time. Current cloud computing performance falls short of systems specifically designed for scientific applications. Scientific computing needs are quite different from those of web applications--composed primarily of database queries--that have been the focus of cloud computing vendors. In this paper we investigate the use of cloud computing for high-performance numerical applications. In particular, we assume unlimited monetary resources to answer the question, "How high can a cloud computing service get in the TOP500 list?" We show results for the Linpack benchmark on different allocations on Amazon EC2.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has been envisioned as the next-generation architecture of IT enterprise. In contrast to traditional solutions, where the IT services are under proper physical, logical and personnel controls, cloud computing moves the application software and databases to the large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been well understood. In this article, we focus on cloud data storage security, which has always been an important aspect of quality of service. To ensure the correctness of users' data in the cloud, we propose an effective and flexible distributed scheme with two salient features, opposing to its predecessors. By utilizing the homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-coded data, our scheme achieves the integration of storage correctness insurance and data error localization, i.e., the identification of misbehaving server (s). Unlike most prior works, the new scheme further supports secure and efficient dynamic operations on data blocks, including: data update, delete and append. Extensive security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and resilient against Byzantine failure, malicious data modification attack, and even server colluding attacks.},
