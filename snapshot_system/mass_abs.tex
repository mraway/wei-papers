Data deduplication is important  for snapshot backup of virtual machines (VMs)
because of excessive redundant content.  Fingerprint search for source-side duplicate 
detection is resource intensive when the backup service for VMs  is co-located with  other 
cloud services.  This paper proposes a low-profile VM-centric backup service with  a tradeoff 
for a competitive deduplication efficiency while using small computing resources, 
suitable for running on a converged cloud architecture that cohosts  many other services.
We follow  a  VM-centric design that restricts global deduplication and 
separates popular chunks with non-popular ones.   
The  proposed techniques  are  similarity-guided local search 
for  improving the effectiveness of  this VM-centric deduplication

%by separating popular chunks and associating  file system blocks with one VM for non-popular chunks.
This  paper  describes an evaluation of this VM-centric scheme to assess  its deduplication 
efficiency, resource usage,  and fault tolerance.
